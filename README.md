## Add to your project ðŸ“‡

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
 ```
Now, add the dependency :
```groovy
  implementation 'com.github.kamaravichow:nokill-android:1.0.0'
```

## Usage Guide ðŸ¤ 

Initialise 
```kotlin
NoKill.init(crashHandler)
 ```
 
#### Best Practice ðŸ˜‹

Best practice to use this library is to initialise it in application class, this will help avoid all kinds of crashes your application can go through.

```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // initialise no kill
        NoKill().init(object : CrashHandler {
            override fun uncaughtException(t: Thread, e: Throwable) {
                showToastOnUIThread(e.message)
            }
        })


    }


    fun showToastOnUIThread(message: String?) {
        Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).post {
            Toast.makeText(
                applicationContext,
                message,
                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
            ).show()
        }
    }
}
```
